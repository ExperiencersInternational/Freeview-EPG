Freeview-EPG is a project designed to provide a reliable source of XMLTV data for UK free-to-air channels. The channel list was designed to match [this](https://github.com/ExperiencersInternational/tvsetup) project as closely as possible, and is a cutdown fork from the [iptv/epg](https://github.com/iptv-org/epg) project. Made by @dp247 and improved upon (albeit quite terribly since I've never coded in Python) by @ExperiencersInternational.

The project works by using Sky's EPG Services or BT's YouView API to parse channel and programme data and then build the resulting dataset into an XMLTV file. The file provides a 48h EPG and is automatically updated every 24 hours. Metadata is bound by both what the API provides and what can be represented in the XMLTV format (see [here](https://github.com/XMLTV/xmltv/blob/master/xmltv.dtd)), but the aim is to at least provide:

- Programme title
- Programme description
- Start and end times
- Some kind of image for the programme (this will probably be a screengrab, which doesn't fit poster-based EPGs like Plex's, but is better than nothing)

## Disclaimers
- I'm open to adding any *free-to-air* channels to this EPG, whether that's for an IPTV channel or a Freeview channel, but I won't be adding PPV or subscription based channels here.
- The software and data is provided as-is. While I intend for it to be as reliable as possible, the data is sourced from respective APIs and is out of my control.


## Usage
Grab the XMLTV file from this link and paste it into your favourite IPTV client:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dp247/Freeview-EPG/master/epg.xml
```

## To-do
- Build EPG data for radio stations
- Experiment with adding more metadata to the XML file (e.g. season/episode numbering and ratings where available)
- Produce a longer EPG

### Adding BBC Radio stations
BBC radio stations can be added to the `freeview_channels.xml` file with the same schema as Sky and BT-sourced channels. With that being said, please set the attributes as so:

| Attribute    | Value       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| src          | bbc_radio   | Used to get dates in correct format and choose correct scraper                                                                                                                                                     |

| xmltv_id     | {name}.uk   | Should start with 'BBCRadio'. Full station names are preferred, but feel free to abbreviate too (e.g. BBCRadio1Dance.uk -> BBCRadio1D.uk)                                                                          |
| site_id      | {id}        | This needs to be taken from the BBC Sounds schedule page's URL. Go to `https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/stations` and select your station's schedule, then copy the bit before the date (Radio 1's is `bbc_radio_one`) |
| channel name | {name text} | Not an XML attribute, but the actual text. Should be the station's full name                                                                                                                                       |
